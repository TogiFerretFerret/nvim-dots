actually high quality neovim dots

built from the ground up by me
don't expect competence
installation: something?? i dont remember
by the way i started pushing it to git only recently but its older trust.
remember to `cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/avante.nvim" and run `make BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true` and not 1, otherwise it won't work and about 100% ish of the features of avante wont work either lol.
